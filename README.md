# RISC-V Simulator (Vsim.py)

## Overview

This is a simple RISC-V simulator implemented in Python. The simulator can load RISC-V assembly programs, disassemble them, and simulate their execution.

## Features

- Load RISC-V assembly programs.
- Disassemble the loaded program and output to a file (`disassembly.txt`).
- Simulate the execution of the loaded program and output simulation details to a file (`simulation.txt`).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   
2. Run the RISC-V simulator with a sample input file (e.g., sample.txt):

   ```bash
   python Vsim.py sample.txt

Feel free to replace sample.txt with the actual name of your input file or update it as needed.
